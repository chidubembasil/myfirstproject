                <strong style="color: red;"><u>Who is a front-end developer</u></strong>
                <br>
                <strong style="color: blue;"><u>A front end developer has one general responsibility: </u></strong>
                <br>
                to ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page. 
                They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming 
                to code a website’s appearance, as well as taking care 
                of debugging. Whenever you visit a website, anything that you see, click on or 
                otherwise use is the work of a front end developer.
                <h4 style="color: red;"></h4>Common Tasks of a Front End Developer</h4>
                Although there is some variation across companies, you can generally expect a 
                front end developer role to include some or all of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimizing the user experience.</li>
                    <li>Using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to bring concepts to life.</li>
                    <li>Developing and maintaining the user interface.</li>
                    <li>Implementing design on mobile websites.</li>
                    <li>Creating tools that improve site interaction regardless of the browser.</li>
                    <li>Managing software workflow.</li>
                    <li>Following SEO best practices.</li>
                    <li>Fixing bugs and testing for usability.</li>                 
                </ul>
                      <strong style="color: red;"><u>Front End Development: </u></strong>
                       <br>
                        <strong style="color: border-left: unset;;"><u>Commonly Used Programming Languages:</u></strong>
                        Most front end developers spend a great deal of their time working in HTML, 
                        CSS and JavaScript, making proficiency in each key to their success.

                    <br>
                    <strong style="color:  blue;"><u>How Developers Use Each Programming Language:</u></strong>
                    <br>
                    Front end developers use <em style="color: blue;">HTML</em> to lay out a document’s general structure 
                    and content, <em style="color: blue;">CSS</em> for styling and JavaScript for situations that require advanced 
                    interactivity. Additionally, they might use AJAX (a combination of <em style="color: blue;">JavaScript</em> and 
                    <em style="color: blue;">XML</em>) to update specific areas of a website without having to refresh the entire 
                    page. 
                    <br>
                    Libraries and Frameworks:
                    Front end developers also commonly use the libraries built on these programming 
                    languages like AngularJS, jQuery and React; and design frameworks including 
                    Foundation and Bootstrap. CSS extensions, such as SASS, provide improved modularity
                    and power. 
                    <br>
                    Additional Front End Development Languages:
                    While they are less common, front end developers may also use Python, 
                    Ruby or PHP to easily connect data with the back end of their website.
                    <br>
                    Responsive design changes a website’s layout depending on the device and screen 
                    size, and occasionally requiring changes to the content and functionality based 
                    on those factors.

                <strong style="color: red;"><u>What is Back-end Development</u></strong>
                <br>
                Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, 
                scripting, website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur 
                when performing any action on a website. It can be an account login or making a 
                purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end developers helps browsers 
                to communicate with database information.
                <br>
                Example:
                <br>
                Most common example of Backend programming is when you are reading an article on 
                the blog. <em style="color: blue;">The fonts, colors, designs, etc</em>. constitute the frontend of this page. 
                While the content of the article is rendered from a server and fetched from a database.
                This is the backend part of the application.

                <strong style="color: red;"><u>Who is a Data analytics (DA)</u></strong>
                <br>
               <mark>Data analytics (DA) is the process of examining data sets to find trends and 
               draw conclusions about the information they contain</mark>. Increasingly, 
               data analytics is done with the aid of specialized systems and software. 
               Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries 
               to enable organizations to make more-informed business decisions. Scientists and 
               researchers also use analytics tools to verify or disprove scientific models, theories 
               and hypotheses.
               As a term, data analytics predominantly refers <strong style="color: yellow;"> to an assortment of applications, 
               from basic business intelligence (BI), reporting and online analytical processing 
               (OLAP) to various forms of advanced analytics</strong>. In that sense, it's similar in nature 
               to business analytics, another umbrella term for approaches to analyzing data. 
               The difference is that the latter is oriented to business uses, while data analytics 
               has a broader focus. The expansive view of the term isn't universal, though: 
               In some cases, people use data analytics specifically to mean advanced analytics, 
               treating BI as a separate category. Data analytics initiatives can help businesses 
               increase revenue, improve operational efficiency, optimize marketing campaigns and 
               bolster customer service efforts. Analytics also enable organizations to respond 
               quickly to emerging market trends and gain a competitive edge over business rivals. 
               Depending on the application, the data that's analyzed can consist of either historical 
               records or new information that has been processed for real-time analytics. 
               In addition, it can come from a mix of internal systems and external data sources.

                is a resolution
                Updating and upgrading the organization’s security systems as needed
                Bear in mind, not all organizations or businesses will want their cybersecurity 
                architect to do every one of these tasks. Conversely, some companies may ask even 
                more of their architects.
                <br>
                <strong style="color: red;"><u>How Do You Become a Cyber Security Architect?</u></strong>
                <br>
                We need to be up-front about this: it takes some work and dedication to become 
                a cybersecurity architect. This is a prestigious, well-paying career with lots 
                of potentials, but you need to put in the time and effort to get there. 
                Fortunately, we’ll show you how to do this! 
                First of all, you need some academic acumen. Conventional wisdom says you need 
                a degree (Bachelor’s or Masters) in cybersecurity, computer science, information 
                technology, or some other related major. If you don’t have this kind of educational
                background, you may be able to squeak by taking some classes that focus on IT.
                Moving away from academia to actual work experience, most businesses and 
                organizations look for candidates with five to 10 years of IT experience in 
                the workplace, including some work with systems analysis, application development, 
                and business planning. Three to five of those years of IT experience should focus 
                on security matters. So, if you have your education and work experience squared 
                away, you’re ready to go. Not exactly. It takes a particular set of skills to excel
                at cybersecurity architecture. In the realm of “soft” skills, the ideal candidate
                is an excellent communicator, a capable leader, and enjoys solving problems. 
                <mark>A cybersecurity architect needs to be able to oversee projects, direct teams, 
                and be able to talk with non-technical people in the organization, relaying 
                concepts that may be difficult for them to grasp</mark>. 
                <br>
                A good cybersecurity architect needs many of the following hard skills:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knowledge of Windows, UNIX, and Linux</li>
                    <li>Understanding of ISO 27001/27002, ITIL, and COBIT frameworks</li>
                    <li>A grasp of perimeter security controls such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, network access 
                    controls, and network segmentation</li>
                    <li>Network security architecture development and definition</li>
                    <li>Experience with the various aspects of wireless security such as routers, switches,
                    and VLAN security</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of security concepts related to DNS, including routing, authentication, 
                    VPN, proxy services, and DDOS mitigation technology</li>
                    <li>An understanding of third party auditing and cloud risk assessment methodology</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

                <strong><u>Who is graphics Designer</u></strong>
                <br>
                <mark>A graphic designer creates visual concepts, using computer software or by hand, 
                to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, or captivate consumers</mark>. They work in a 
                variety of industries, including advertising, marketing, and publishing, and use 
                their skills to create logos, brochures, websites, packaging, and other promotional 
                materials. Graphic designers are responsible for creating visually appealing designs 
                that communicate a specific message or concept to the intended audience. They must also

                <mark>UI Designer — or User Interface Designer — designs all the screens through which a 
                user will move while using a website, app, or video game, while also creating the 
                visual design elements that make this movement possible</mark>. In other words, UI Designers 
                are responsible for creating what users see when they visit a website or product.
                Because UI design is a subset of UX design (user experience design), UI and UX are 
                often wrongfully used interchangeably and outsiders to the industry might not 
                understand the difference between a UI and UX Designer. Although they both share a 
                goal ensuring a positive user experience. UI design is in fact a different part of 
                the UX design journey and is hugely important in its own right. UI Designers and others 
                who specialize in user interface design work closely with user experience designers 
                (UX Designers) as well as other team members who work in product, development, and 
                marketing to ultimately ensure that users have smooth and positive experiences 
                navigating products.

                <br>
                <strong style="color: red;"><u>What Are UI Design Job Responsibilities?</u></strong>
                <br>
                UI design professionals are responsible for creating, designing, and organizing 
                interactive elements, usually in close collaboration with UX Designers who will 
                have mapped out a vision for the project.
                Depending on seniority and the specific work situation  for instance, whether someone 
                is part of an in-house design team for a company, working for an agency with clients 
                to please, or working freelance UI and UX Designers usually work in close collaboration
                with a Product Designer and possibly a client at the beginning of the design process, 
                going over questions about functionality, visual design, and the desired look and feel.
                Exactly how much input a UI expert has into this initial phase of the design process 
                does depend largely on seniority. Senior UI design professionals might take the lead 
                on conjuring up ideas for what visual elements will work best, while it’s likely that 
                someone in an entry-level UI design role would likely not have much input into the
                look and feel of the site, instead of focusing on storyboards, sitemaps and process 
                flows. As the design process continues, UI design pros are responsible for taking the 
                insights unearthed by user research and personas  typically the territory of UX 
                Designers and running with it. Armed with that information, it’s time to work on user 
                interfaces by crafting interactive design elements like buttons, tabs, menus, widgets, 
                scrollbars, sliders, and search fields. Depending again on the role and seniority, a UI
                pro might also have input on fonts, layouts, color, graphic design elements, images, 
                animations, and icons. During this design phase, a UI design professional might be 
                responsible for all of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating and enforcing a style guide or visual language/to ensure 
                        consistency across the board.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing every individual screen the user might interact with, making 
                        decisions about which layout and visual design elements will help create 
                        the most intuitive-possible user experience?
                    </li>
                    <li>Designing the interactivity of each user interface (UI) element.</li>
                    <li>Creating animations.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that a layout will work well across a range of different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>Once those designs are in place, it’s testing time and that means prototyping. 
                        Prototypes allow UI design experts to see their visual designs in action, and 
                        subsequently, quickly spot problems and polish any rough spots. Prototyping and 
                        testing are an essential part of user interface design workflow.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Depending on the project and which phase of the design process they’re in, 
                a UI Designer might use the following three different types of prototypes:</strong>
                <br>
                Low-fidelity wireframes. Quickly sketching user flows on paper or a whiteboard is the 
                cheapest and fastest way to convey a design idea.
                <br>
                Clickable prototypes. Now that screen layout, the user journey, and overall visual 
                design is set, a clickable prototype a static screen with at least a medium level of 
                detail can be created.
                <br>
                High-fidelity prototypes. When it’s time to finalize designs before handing them off 
                to developers, high-fidelity prototypes with advanced interactions can be created that 
                should closely resemble the finished product.
                <br>
                UI Designers have plenty of prototyping tools to choose from. 
                <em style="color: blue;">InVision and Sketch are popular prototyping tools (they’re also helpful if you need 
                to design wireframes). If the prototyping needs are more advanced, they might turn 
                to Proto.io, Principle, Flinto, or ProtoPie</em>.
